## Windows

> Remark: The underlying technical solution implemented by Docker Desktop under Windows is based on virtual machine technology, and the nat network mode is used by default. Because of this, there might be unexpected behaviors in some scenarios when using tools such as Nmap for LAN scanning.

### 1. Install Docker
Pre-knowledge: [What is Docker](https://www.redhat.com/zh/topics/containers/what-is-docker)

Reference：[Install Docker Desktop on Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/)

If Docker is installed on your device, please check its version number. Leviathan supports **20.10.10** and above. If this condition is met, you can skip this step, otherwise, please install or update Docker

The system configuration for installing Docker on Windows mainly consists of the following two types:

- WSL 2 backend

- Hyper-V backend and Windows containers

#### 1.1 Enable CPU virtualization support

Enter the BIOS settings in system and check whether the BIOS has enabled CPU virtualization support as below.

#### 1.2 Win10 Home Edition Pre-step

It is strongly recommended to upgrade to Win10 Professional version or use Linux, Mac. **If you use Win10 Professional Edition, Enterprise Edition or Education Edition, please skip this step and enter 1.3.**

First, you need to enable the Hyper-V module. The Windows Home Edition cannot query the 'Hyper-V' function module. It needs to be enabled in a particular way as follows:

Update the operating system to the latest version, Windows Settings -> Update -> Check for updates

Enable the display of file extensions. For details [refer to File Extension Display](https://jingyan.baidu.com/article/f7ff0bfcc9c0e12e26bb13a0.html)		

Copy the following code into a new document:		

```vbscript
pushd "%~dp0"
dir /b %SystemRoot%\servicing\Packages\*Hyper-V*.mum >hyper-v.txt
for /f %%i in ('findstr /i . hyper-v.txt 2^>nul') do dism /online /norestart /add-package:"%SystemRoot%\servicing\Packages\%%i"
del hyper-v.txt
Dism /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Hyper-V-All /LimitAccess /ALL
```

Save the document as install-hyper-v.cmd, right click and run as administrator.

![install hyper-v.png](https://levimg.s3.cn-northwest-1.amazonaws.com.cn/l/3.1-2.png)		

After the installation is completed, enter Y and restart. (Note: **If the system is updated after the installation is completed, it may cause the installation to be invalid, you need to check, and if necessary, reinstall hyper-v**)			

Repeat the above steps, save the following code as change.cmd and run as administrator.

```cmd
"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion" /v EditionId /T REG_EXPAND_SZ /d Professional /F
```

Now, the Win10 Home Edition Hyper-V should be enabled.

#### 1.3 Win10 Professional Edition, Enterprise Edition, Education Edition

Please choose one of the following two methods based on the solution you use:

- WSL 2 backend

> To install WSL 2, please refer to the link [Install WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
>
> To enable virtualization, please refer to the link to [enable virtualization](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/troubleshoot/#virtualization)，and the setting method is `Control Panel` -> `Programs` -> `Enable or Disable Windows Functions` -> Check `Windows Subsystem for Linux` and `Virtual Machine Platform`, and then follow the prompts to restart.

- Hyper-V backend and Windows containers

> `Control Panel` -> `Programs` -> `Enable or Disable Windows Functions` -> Check `Hyper-V`, then follow the prompts to restart.

The following steps are common and must be performed on all Windows systems:​			

- Check whether virtualization is enabled. For details, please refer to [Virtualization Check](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/troubleshoot/#virtualization-must-be-enabled)

- Download [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/), install the executable file

- After the restart, Docker Desktop will run automatically

When the Docker Logo on the lower left corner is green, it means you have successfully launched Docker!

### 2. Install Python3.10

Please go to the [python official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download the python installation package (version ≥ 3.10 is required), click it and install.

### 3. Install PDM 

PDM is a modern Python package manager that supports [PEP 582](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0582/). It is similar to npm, installing and managing packages in a way that doesn't require creating a virtualenv. 

Leviathan use PDM for testing, publishing and dependency management.

> [Whata is PDM？](https://pdm.fming.dev/)

**Recommended installation method**

Use the script provided by the official website to specify the version to install:

```bash
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pdm-project/pdm/main/install-pdm.py -UseBasicParsing).Content | python -
```

> Execute in cmd or powershell

### 4. Install pdm-lev plugin

pdm-lev is a pdm plugin provided by Leviathan, which is used for project construction, development, testing and management, and can automatically generate the Leviathan project framework.

Install using the following command:

```bash
pdm plugin add pdm-lev
```

After the execution is completed, the terminal returns

```bash
✔ Installation succeeds.
```

It means the installation is successful.

> The latest version of pdm-lev is 1.2.6, and the installed version can be judged by the following command:
>
> ```bash
> pdm plugin list
> ```
>
> If it is found that the version of pdm-lev is too low, it is most likely caused by the source not being synchronized in time. Just switch the source of python and reinstall it.

> pdm-lev does not provide an automatic upgrade method for the time being. You can use the following commands to upgrade manually:
>
> ```bash
> $ pdm plugin remove pdm-lev
> $ pdm plugin add pdm-lev
> ```

### 5. IDE configuration

In order for the IDE to work, we first have to enable the pep582 proposal globally.

> Q：What is pep582 proposal?（refer to the link [pep582](https://peps.python.org/pep-0582/)）
>
> A：The pep582 configuration allows the python interpreter to automatically look for `__pypackages__` in the current working directory and its parent directories. That is, if you don't want to add a pdm run every time you execute a command, you can directly set the variable to the current environment, you only need to use the shell program in pdm --pep582 to enable pep582

Use the following command in `powershell` to add `pep582` to the system environment variables:

```powershell
pdm --pep582
```

Next configure the IDE to enable the IDE to support PDM:

#### VSCode settings
```bash
# Add the following two items to the top-level dictionary in .vscode/settings.json:
{
  "python.autoComplete.extraPaths": ["__pypackages__/<major.minor>/lib"],
  "python.analysis.extraPaths": ["__pypackages__/<major.minor>/lib"]
}
```

> Note: The `<major.minor>` above is the version number of python, such as `__pypackages__/3.10/lib` .
