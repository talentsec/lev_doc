## Example of workflow

### 1. What is workflow？

By functional definition, workflow is the calling center of various tools and the commander of task scheduling.

From an implementation perspective, on Leviathan, the exported asynchronous function is the workflow.

> Q: From an implementation perspective, what is a tool?
>
> A: Exported module - multi-mode tool; synchronous function returning Cr - single-mode tool.

As a developer, you can quickly implement a workflow in the Leviathan community that has rich tools and an automatic workflow ecosystem without having to develop your own tools. In this case, what will be uploaded to Leviathan will be a `workflow package` - "only contains workflow package".

> The so-called multi-tool workflow is to uniformly schedule the processing tasks of multiple tools and distribute the results after execution to the next/multiple tasks for execution.

### 2. Simple workflow

In the `whtcjdtc2008.hello_world/lev/whtcjdtc2008/hello_world` directory, create a new `asset.py` file to create the workflow:

> Q: Is the filename of asset.py used for workflow fixed?
>
> A: No, you can name it as you like.

````python
from levrt import ctx, annot, Concurrent
from . import hello

@annot.meta(
    desc = "hello world",
    params = [annot.Param("length", "exp length", holder = "9")]
)
async def hello_world(length: int):
    """
    my first asset
    ```
    await hello_world(9)
    ```
    """

    import logging
    logging.basicConfig()
    logger = logging.getLogger("lev")
    logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
    logger.debug("[lev app - hello world] log from asset - start point")

    doc = await hello.hello()
    data = await doc.get()
    logger.debug(f"[lev app - hello world] {data['msg']}")

    doc = await hello.hi()
    data = await doc.get()
    logger.debug(f"[lev app - hello world] {data['msg']}")

    doc = await hello.exp()
    data = await doc.get()
    logger.debug(f"[lev app - hello world] {data['msg']}")

    logger.debug("[lev app - hello world] log from asset - end point")

````

As you can see, the workflow code is very simple to implement, just invoke the created tool. To ensure that workflow function `hello_world` can be called, we also need to export the `hello_world` function in __init__.py:

```python
from levrt import annot
from . import hello
from .asset import hello_world

__lev__ = annot.meta([hello, hello_world])
```

Next, we make a simple modification to `main.py` so that it can invoke the workflow when testing locally:

```python
import levrt
from lev.whtcjdtc2008.hello_world import hello, hello_world

async def main():
    data = await hello_world(9)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import logging
    logging.basicConfig()
    logger = logging.getLogger("lev")
    logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
    logger.debug("[lev app - hello world] debug test")
    levrt.run(main())
```

Use `pdm run python main.py` to run the local test, you can see that the workflow `hello_world` invokes the `hello`, `hi` and `exp` modes respectively, and outputs the following results:

```bash
┌─[hunter@192] - [~/Workspace/lev_hub/whtcjdtc2008.hello_world] - [10027]

```

### 3. Introduce community ecology

The developed community ecology provides a wide array of tools, so how do you make the most of them when orchestrating?

First, open the Leviathan platform, log in to the account and enter the `Market`, select the type as `Tool`, and select the filter option as `Official`, and then you can see the security tools supported by the Leviathan official team:

> Q: What is special about security tools supported by the Leviathan official team?
>
> A: The tools and workflows supported by the `official Leviathan team` are with `Official` tag. These tools and workflow are integrated into the Leviathan platform by the official team. The image and source code have been audited, which guarantees the quality and security of tools.

Here we choose `jsfuck` to provide "hello" from java_script for the `hello_world` workflow:

![](https://levimg.s3.cn-northwest-1.amazonaws.com.cn/l/12-2.png)

In the upper-left corner of the `jsfuck` tool page, to the right of the tool icon, you can see the `package` name `lev.joe.jsfuck` to which the tool belongs, and you can see the code example in the section `Example of Access Mode`.

Go back to the `whtcjdtc2008.hello_world` directory and add `package` to the project with the following command:

```bash
pdm add lev.joe.jsfuck
```

The following output shows that `lev.joe.jsfuck` has been successfully added to the project:

Next, simply modify the `hello_world` workflow, import `lev.joe.jsfuck` and invoke the jsfuck function:

```python
from levrt import ctx, annot, Concurrent
from . import hello
from lev.joe.jsfuck import jsfuck

@annot.meta(
    desc = "hello world",
    params = [annot.Param("length", "exp length", holder = "9")]
)
async def hello_world(length: int):
    """
    my first asset
    ```
    await hello_world(9)
    ```
    """

    import logging
    ...

    doc = await jsfuck.encode("hello world", False, False)
    data = await doc.get()
    logger.debug(f"[lev app - hello world] {data}")

    logger.debug("[lev app - hello world] log from asset - end point")
```

Run it with `pdm run python main.py`, and then you can see the following results. The `hello_world` workflow is saying hello to the world in 4 different ways:

> Finally, don't forget to push the update to the Leviathan platform and to start testing on the platform, so the others in the community can use the tool.
