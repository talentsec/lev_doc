## Introduction and Concepts

1. Tool

   A tool is a script or an application that performs specific functions. Some well-known tools include nmap, checkdmarc, etc.

   Each tool consists of one or more modes, so what is a mode?

   One specific way of invoking a tool is a mode. It's usually used to complete a specified type of task.

   For example, cyber security tools usually consist of a group of parameters. To use the tool, users need to go through the document and type in the parameters differently, which is pretty complicated. 
   
   On LEV, however, tool developers can encapsulate these parameters (or some common and fixed parameter names, commands, or usage methods of tools) into specific functions.
   
   These encapsulated functions are modes. 

   For example,

   ```bash
   $ nmap -sS -Pn -p- -T4 --open -O -oX /tmp/port_os.xml 192.168.1.1/24
   ```

   This command can be encapsulated as a mode of the nmap tool.

2. Workflow

   A workflow is a collection of tool invocation. Multiple specified tools will be invoked in sequence in a workflow. 
   
   When one performs certain cyber security tasks, it's common thant he/she may need to use multiple tools or modes. In fact, such combination of tools and modes is abstract and automatic. The combination can be abstracted into a function, namely the LEV workflow.
