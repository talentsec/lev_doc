## Local testing

### 1. Print the log

During development, printing the log will be a very important debugging method. You can add the following code to `main.py` to achieve log output:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig()
logger = logging.getLogger("lev")
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
logger.debug("[lev app - hello world] debug test")
```

The complete `main.py` code is as follows:

```python
import levrt
from lev.whtcjdtc2008.hello_world import hello

async def main():
    doc = await hello.exp(9)
    data = await doc.get()
    print(data["msg"])


if __name__ == "__main__":
    import logging
    logging.basicConfig()
    logger = logging.getLogger("lev")
    logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
    logger.debug("[lev app - hello world] debug test")
    levrt.run(main())
```

Run with `pdm run python main.py` and you can see that the log has been printed to the terminal:

```bash
┌─[hunter@192] - [~/Workspace/lev_hub/whtcjdtc2008.hello_world] - [10085]
└─[$] pdm run python main.py                                                                                                                [12:02:24]
DEBUG:lev:[lev app - hello world] debug test
INFO:lev:job: whtcjdtc2008 main 711
INFO:lev:progress: 0.0
INFO:lev:progress: 0.25
2.718281828
```

### 2. Debugger

During development, it is difficult to solve the problem accurately and efficiently only by relying on the log. At this time, the debugger will become an important helper.

Here we use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for dynamic debugging.

### 3. Container logs

If we need to print the log when the tool is executed, we also need to use the `logging` library and add the log-related code to the `exp` function:

```python
@annot.meta(
    desc="Exp",
    params=[annot.Param("name", "person name")],
    cats=[Attck.Reconnaissance],
)
def exp(length: int = 9) -> Cr:
    """
    The third tool mode of Hello World
    ```
    await exp(9)
    ```
    """
    @levrt.remote
    def entry():
        import sys
        sys.path.append('/usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages')
        import numpy,logging
        logging.basicConfig()
        logger = logging.getLogger("lev")
        logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
        logger.debug("[lev app - hello world] log from container")
        res = round(numpy.e, length)
        ctx.set(msg=res)

    return Cr("86cf12987", entry=entry())
```

After running `pdm run python main.py`, you will find that the terminal does not output the log printed in the `exp` function. This is because the running environment of the tool is a container, so we need to use the container log command to view:

```bash
docker ps -a | grep [job_id]
docker logs [container_name]
```

> job_id can be found from the output of pdm run python main.py
> ```bash
> DEBUG:lev:[lev app - hello world] debug test
> INFO:lev:job: whtcjdtc2008 main 718 <- job_id
> INFO:lev:progress: 0.0
> INFO:lev:progress: 0.25
> 2.718281828
> ```

After running the container log command, you can see that the log information we printed in the tool is:

```bash
┌─[hunter@192] - [~/Workspace/lev_hub/whtcjdtc2008.hello_world] - [10044]
└─[$] docker ps -a | grep 718                                                            [21:20:46]
85c2ca8d3215   86cf12987                                                        "lev func gaRmdW5jyA…"   8 seconds ago    Exited (0) 6 seconds ago                                                    whtcjdtc2008-718-0
┌─[hunter@192] - [~/Workspace/lev_hub/whtcjdtc2008.hello_world] - [10045]
└─[$] docker logs whtcjdtc2008-718-0                                                     [21:20:52]
DEBUG:lev:[lev app - hello world] log from container
```

### 4. Container dynamic debugging

If the tools inside the container go wrong, dynamic debugging is still the best solution. Leviathan provides a command-line debugging interface for developers, so let's take a quick look.

First, modify the `exp` code so that it breaks for debugging:

```python
@annot.meta(
    desc="Exp",
    params=[annot.Param("name", "person name")],
    cats=[Attck.Reconnaissance],
)
def exp(length: int = 9) -> Cr:
    """
    The third tool mode of Hello World
    ```
    await exp(9)
    ```
    """
    @levrt.remote
    def entry():
        import sys, pdb
        sys.path.append('/usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages')
        import numpy,logging
        logging.basicConfig()
        logger = logging.getLogger("lev")
        logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
        pdb.set_trace()
        logger.debug("[lev app - hello world] log from container")
        res = round(numpy.e, length)
        ctx.set(msg=res)

    return Cr("86cf12987", entry=entry())
```

Use the following command to connect to the dynamic debugging interface in the container:

```bash
ssh -t lev debug whtcjdtc2008-719-0
```

> [whtcjdtc2008-719-0] in the above command needs to be changed to the name of the container you are running

After access, you need to press the `Enter key` once to wake up pdb, and then enter `n` to single-step execution, you can see the result:

```bash
(Pdb) n
DEBUG:lev:[lev app - hello world] log from container
```

> It should be noted that during pdb debugging, the source code printed by the l command is not the real source code, and the developer needs to compare it with the local code according to the number of lines of code.

### 5. Troubleshoot the cause of abnormal failure

There are many reasons why you may encounter failures during the test. Here are some common ones:

* Connect call failed ('127.0.0.1', 38379)

  Because of the defects of docker itself, after the computer sleeps, the containers cannot access each other, and the docker service needs to be restarted

* device offline

  The agent cannot connect to the server, you need to execute the following command to re-run the agent
  ```bash
  ssh lev agent | sudo docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/docker --rm -i talentsec/lev
  ```
