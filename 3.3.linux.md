## Linux

### 1. Installation Environment Requirements

The installation of the development environment is divided into the following 6 steps

- Install Docker 

- Install Openssl 

- Install Python 

- Install PDM 

- Install PDM plugin 

- Configure IDE

If you already have certain environments pre-installed, you can skip the corresponding steps and continue the installation from the back.

> Installation Environment Requirements:
>
> Operating system：x86_64
>
> Python：3.10 and above（openssl 1.1.1 and above）

### 2. Install Docker

Please refer to Docker [Official Installation Tutorial](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

> In order to achieve the integrity of function access, please confirm that the version of Docker Engine you installed is 20.10.10 and above.

### 3. Development environment installation

#### Option 1: Recommended installation method

##### CentOS 7 / 9：

Copy the following command and run it directly:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/talentsec/lev_installation/main/lev_installation_for_centos.sh && chmod +x lev_installation_for_centos.sh && source ./lev_installation_for_centos.sh
```

##### CentOS 8:

CentOS 8: Since the package has been removed from mirror, you need to switch the source to Steam 8, execute the following command:

```bash
dnf --disablerepo '*' --enablerepo extras swap centos-linux-repos centos-stream-repos
dnf distro-sync
```

If you want to know more details, you can refer to the following links:
[Convert to CentOS Stream 8](https://www.centos.org/news-and-events/convert-to-stream-8/)

After switching to Steam 8, execute the following command to install:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/talentsec/lev_installation/main/lev_installation_for_centos.sh && chmod +x lev_installation_for_centos.sh && source ./lev_installation_for_centos.sh
```

##### Ubuntu 14.04 / 16.04 / 18.04 / 20.04 / 22.04:

Copy the following command and run it directly:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/talentsec/lev_installation/main/lev_installation_for_debian_and_ubuntu.sh && chmod +x lev_installation_for_debian_and_ubuntu.sh && source ./lev_installation_for_debian_and_ubuntu.sh
```

##### Debian 8 / 9 / 10 / 11:
Copy the following command and run it directly:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/talentsec/lev_installation/main/lev_installation_for_debian_and_ubuntu.sh && chmod +x lev_installation_for_debian_and_ubuntu.sh && source ./lev_installation_for_debian_and_ubuntu.sh
```

#### Option 2：Step-by-step installation
##### Install openssl
According to PEP 644, python 3.10 needs the support of openssl 1.1.1 and above, so systems with lower openssl versions need to compile a new openssl environment separately.

> Execute the command `openssl version` to view the version of openssl.

The installation process of openssl will be different in different systems. For details, please refer to the followings:

[Installation file for Debian/Ubuntu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/talentsec/lev_installation/main/lev_installation_for_debian_and_ubuntu.sh)

[Installation file for CentOS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/talentsec/lev_installation/main/lev_installation_for_centos.sh)

#####  Install python3.10

The main language of Leviathan is python 3, and the version requirements are python 3.10 and above.

> Because of different operating systems, such as Ubuntu 20.04 uses python 3.8 by default, so it needs to be upgraded.

> Linux users should upgrade the python version with caution. Please do not use PPA source to install python 3.10. You need to manually compile the source code for installation, otherwise it will affect the operation of the internal programs of the system, such as the apt tool of the debian series.

The installation process of python 3.10 will be different in different systems. For details, please refer to the followings:

[Installation file for Debian/Ubuntu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/talentsec/lev_installation/main/lev_installation_for_debian_and_ubuntu.sh)

[Installation file for CentOS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/talentsec/lev_installation/main/lev_installation_for_centos.sh)

Enter `python3.10` in the terminal and enter the execution environment of python 3.10.4 is successful.

> (optional)
> Configure pip source to speed up the use of pip in China：

   ```bash
   # Write the following to ~/.pip/pip.conf
   [global]
   index-url = https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple/
   [install]
   trusted-host = pypi.douban.com
   ```

##### Install pdm

pdm is a modern python package manager, Leviathan uses it for package management.

> pdm supports [PEP 582](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0582/)。
>
> Extension: [What is PDM？](https://pdm.fming.dev/)
>
> PDM officail website: [https://pdm.fming.dev/](https://pdm.fming.dev/)

Use the following command to install pdm:
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pdm-project/pdm/main/install-pdm.py | python3.10 -
```

> After PDM is installed, use the following command to add the path of pdm to the system environment variable:
>
> `export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin`
> **Executing this sentence in the terminal can temporarily add environment variables, the restart will disappear**，you can write it into `/etc/profile`，or`.bashrc`，`.zshrc` files

#### Install pdm-lev plugin

pdm-lev is a pdm plugin provided by Leviathan, which is used for project construction, development, testing and management, and can automatically generate the Leviathan project framework.

Install using the following command:

```bash
pdm plugin add pdm-lev
```

After the execution is completed, the terminal returns

```bash
✔ Installation succeeds.
```

It means the installation is successful.

> The latest version of pdm-lev is 1.2.6, and the installed version can be judged by the following command:
>
> ```bash
> pdm plugin list
> ```
>
> If it is found that the version of pdm-lev is too low, it is most likely caused by the source not being synchronized in time. Just switch the source of python and reinstall it.

> pdm-lev does not provide an automatic upgrade method for the time being. You can use the following commands to upgrade manually:

>
> ```bash
> $ pdm plugin remove pdm-lev
> $ pdm plugin add pdm-lev
> ```

### 4. IDE configuration
In order for the IDE to work, we first have to enable the pep582 proposal globally.

> Q：What is pep582 proposal?（refer to the link [pep582](https://peps.python.org/pep-0582/)）
>
> A：：The pep582 configuration allows the python interpreter to automatically look for `__pypackages__`in the current working directory and its parent directories. That is, if you don't want to add a pdm run every time you execute a command, you can directly set the variable to the current environment, you only need to use the shell program in pdm --pep582 to enable pep582.

Use the following command to add pep582 to the system environment variables:

```bash
pdm --pep582 >> ~/[your profile name]
source ~/[your profile name]

# example: pdm --pep582 >> ~/.zsh
```

Next configure the IDE to enable the IDE to support PDM:


###### VSCode settings
```bash
# Add the following two items to the top-level dictionary in .vscode/settings.json:
{
  "python.autoComplete.extraPaths": ["__pypackages__/<major.minor>/lib"],
  "python.analysis.extraPaths": ["__pypackages__/<major.minor>/lib"]
}
```

> Note: The `<major.minor>` above is the version number of python, such as `__pypackages__/3.10/lib` 。
