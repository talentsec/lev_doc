#### 2.3 Run a tool

As you can see, `nmap` provides 5 modes for invocation： `raw`, `typical`, `alive`, `traceroute`, and `port_os` . It is worth mentioning that most official tools provide multiple modes along with raw mode.

> raw mode: can think of it as native mode, a non-sceneized usage mode
>
> Other modes: different modes that satisfy more scenarios

Here we are going to use the `traceroute` mode. In the `Instruction` section, tool author has introduced how this mode is supposed to work:

Click `New task`, enter the `Add task` page, select the `nmap route tracing...` mode, and you can see the parameter group that needs to be configured. Fill in the content to be configured, and click `Submit ` to run the tool.

### 3. View results

After the task is executed, click the `Task Result` button to view the running result of the task. This nmap task particularly allows us to determine the routing node from the task executor to `lev.zone`.

> Note: Since the implementation of Docker Desktop on the Mac/Windows platform is not complete, the traceroute function of nmap may result in abnormal results on Mac/Win. Therefore, in high-reliability scenarios, it is recommended to use the Linux platform as the execution environment of LEV.
