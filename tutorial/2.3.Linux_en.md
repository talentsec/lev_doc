This command will automatically pull the image and start the container, and the whole process may take a few minutes.
> If the pulling of containers is too slow due to network, you can speed it up by changing the docker image source.
>
> Input the content as below in a new  `/etc/docker/daemon.json` 
>
> ```json
> {
>   "registry-mirrors": [
>     "https://mirror.baidubce.com"
>   ]
> }
> ```
>
> Restart the Docker service with the following command：
> ```bash
> sudo systemctl daemon-reload
> sudo systemctl restart docker
> ```
>
> Use `docker info`to see whether the image source is set up successfully or not.

After the command is executed, you can check the `Account Avatar` - `Account Settings` - `My Device` page, and the device should be online.
