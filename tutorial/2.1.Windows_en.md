### Windows

#### 1. Docker Installation

Pre-knowledge：[What is Docker](https://www.redhat.com/zh/topics/containers/what-is-docker)

Reference：[Install Docker Desktop on Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/)

If Docker is installed on your device, please check its version number. Leviathan supports **20.10.10** and above. If so, you can skip this step, otherwise, please install or update Docker

The system configuration for installing Docker on Windows mainly consists of the following two types:

- WSL 2 backend

- Hyper-V backend and Windows containers

##### 1.1 Enable CPU to support virtualization

Enter the system BIOS setting, and check whether the BIOS has enabled CPU virtualization support, as shown in the following figure:

##### 1.2 Win10 Home Edition - Preliminary Steps

We strongly recommend you to upgrade to Win10 Professional or use Linux & Mac. **If you are using Win10 Professional Edition / Enterprise Edition / Education Edition, please skip this step and enter 1.3.**

First, you need to enable the hyper-v module. Windows Home Edition cannot query the hyper-v function module. It needs to be enabled in a particular way, as follows:

Update the operating system to the latest version.
Windows Setting -> Updates -> Check for Updates

Enable "show file extensions"
Reference: [show file extension](https://jingyan.baidu.com/article/f7ff0bfcc9c0e12e26bb13a0.html)		

Copy the following code into the new document:			

```vbscript
pushd "%~dp0"
dir /b %SystemRoot%\servicing\Packages\*Hyper-V*.mum >hyper-v.txt
for /f %%i in ('findstr /i . hyper-v.txt 2^>nul') do dism /online /norestart /add-package:"%SystemRoot%\servicing\Packages\%%i"
del hyper-v.txt
Dism /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Hyper-V-All /LimitAccess /ALL
```

Save the document as install-hyper-v.cmd, right click "run as administrator":

![安装hyper-v.png](https://levimg.s3.cn-northwest-1.amazonaws.com.cn/x/61620bb6-2a0d-4974-a27c-39471f7c0020.png)		

Enter Y after installation, and Restart (Note: **If you update the system after the installation, it may lead to the invalid hyper-v installation. Remember to double-check and re-install hyper-v if needed.**)			

Repeat the steps above, save the following code as change.cmd, and run as administrator:

```cmd
"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion" /v EditionId /T REG_EXPAND_SZ /d Professional /F
```

At this point, Windows 10 Home Edition hyper-v is enabled.

##### 1.3 Win10 Professional Edition, Enterprise Edition, Education Edition

Please choose one of the following two methods:

- WSL 2 backend

> Install WSL 2. Reference:  [Install WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/zh-cn/windows/wsl/install)
>
> Enable virtualization. Reference:  [Enable virtualization](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/troubleshoot/#virtualization)
> Specific setting path: `Control Panel` -> `Programs` -> `Enable or Disable Windows Features` -> Check `Windows Subsystem for Linux` and `Virtual Machine Platform`, and then follow the prompts to restart.

- Hyper-V backend and Windows containers

> `Control Panel` -> `Programs` -> `Enable or Disable Windows Features` -> Check `Hyper-V`, then follow the prompts to restart.

The following steps are generic and must be performed on all Windows systems: ​			

- Check if Virtualization is enabled. Reference:  [Virtualization check](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/troubleshoot/#virtualization-must-be-enabled)

- Download [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/), and install the executable file.

- After restart, Docker Desktop will run automatically

If the docker engine logo in the lower-left corner of the graphical interface is green, that means Docker is successfully installed and initiated.

#### 2 Token uploads and acquisition


#### 2.4 Start

On the `Account Avatar` - `Account Settings` - `My Device` page, select `Add Device`, enter a name at will, and click Submit.

**After that, click the "copy" button of the device, execute the command on the clipboard in the terminal, and enable the local environment.**

This command will automatically pull the image and start the container, and the whole process may take a few minutes.

After the command is executed, on the `Account Avatar` - `Account Settings` - `My Device` page, you can see that the device is online.

> If the speed of pulling containers is too slow due to network reasons, it can be accelerated by replacing the docker image source.
>
> Open Docker, click Settings, click Docker Engine, and you will see the following page

> Copy the code:
> ```Bash
> "registry-mirrors": [
>   "https://docker.mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/"
> ]
> ```
>
> Paste the code as follows (Tips for beginners: remember to add a comma beneath`"buildkit": true` after the curly braces; otherwise, an exception will occur):

>
> Click Apply&Restart and you're done!
>
> After completing the acceleration operations as above, you should execute the following command again to start the local environment:
>
> ```bash
> ssh lev agent | docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/docker --rm -i talentsec/lev
> ```

After the command is executed, you can check the `Account Avatar` - `Account Settings` - `My Device` page, and the device should be online.
