## General Introduction To Leviathan Framework

### What is Leviathan

Leviathan is an automated task scheduling and orchestration platform that realizes the modularization, standardization, and automation of General Security Capabilities. **With Leviathan, users can execute defensive & offensive tools in any system environment. Users can even directly leverage automated tasks to perform offensive security jobs, reducing a 10-hour work to a 30-min one**.

【The underlying implementation of Leviathan】**Leviathan achieves standardized distribution by containerizing security tools. To achieve standardized invocation and interaction, Leviathan distributes code logic to distributed network containers via closures.** For example, developers can quickly orchestrate and combine a wide array of tools (i.e., Nmap/ RustScan/ Amass/ Wappalyer and other industry-leading tools & projects) within 30 minutes to build an automated and easy-to-use Attack Surface Management Application (ASM). Most of these tools can be integrated into Leviathan in a modular and standardized way. Both developers and users can get started quickly and easily. The learning curve of a tool is way less steep, and therefore the full potential of tools can be completely released.

No matter it’s a tool or a complex application, it can be integrated into Leviathan in a standardized way. Therefore, the tool/ application can be distributed quickly, standardly, and easily. Without configuring and installing the complicated environments, diving into how the tool works, or invoking tools manually, users can quickly complete corresponding tasks.

Leviathan is developed upon containerization and orchestration technology. It supports Windows, Linux, and Mac platforms. Currently, Leviathan supports dynamic deployment, debugging and tool interaction. Ultimately, Leviathan’s goal is to empower users to run tools in a cross-network, cross-system, and cross-platform environment, realizing non-intrusive automated tool integration and becoming the “native operating system for distributed computing environments.“
