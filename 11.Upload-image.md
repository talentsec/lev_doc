## Upload image

Now you have built your first tool `hello world` with 3 modes `hello`, `hi` and `exp` , it's not powerful enough, but don't worry, any great project starts from this moment.

Next, we will learn how to share this tool with the entire Leviathan community, and it is through the power of the community that everyone gets support and growth.

### 1. Create a GitHub Repo

> Q: Does it have to be GitHub?
>
> A: Yes, the API access of other platforms is still in progress, so only GitHub is supported for the time being.

First, log in to your GitHub account, create an empty repo for yourself, give it a name you like, and fill in the description, here's what I filled in:

```
Repository name = lev.whtcjdtc2008.hello_world
Description = My first lev project.
```

Next, upload your tools to the repo you just created:

### 2. Build the image

Having put the code in the GitHub repo, let's go back to Leviathan.

After login, go to `Account Avatar` - `Account Settings` - `Developer Settings`, select `Bind GitHub account`, and log in and authorize according to the options popped up by GitHub:

Remember the image we used when we wrote the `exp` mode? That's right, it's the following line of code:

```python
def exp(...):
  ...
  return Cr("86cf12987", entry=entry())
```

The image address used in the function `Cr` is built locally. After sharing it with the Leviathan community, we need to set the image address to be publicly accessible so that others can run it.

Leviathan supports the image building function, enter the `Repository` - `Image Management` page, select `Add Image`, you can see that the repo inside the GitHub account we just bound can already be used to build the image, select the repo and fill in the relevant information:

![](https://levimg.s3.cn-northwest-1.amazonaws.com.cn/l/11-4.png)

> Note: Check `Set as public` so that other people can access it, and your own private projects can be unchecked

It can be seen that after clicking `SUBMIT`, an image has appeared on the Image Management page. It should be noted that the image collection is displayed here. We need to select `View` to enter the Building page, and then select `Build Rules` - `Add Rules` to set the image building rules , the rule of configuration is very simple:

```
Building Type: Branch
branch/tag: main
path:/
Dockerfile: Dockerfile
Tag: v1.0
```
> The above configuration can be understood as the Dockerfile used to build the image is located in the / directory of the `branch (main)` of the repo, the name of the Dockerfile is `Dockerfile`, and the tag is `v1.0` after the image is built.

After selecting `Submit`, you can see that several buttons appear after the rule you just added. Select `Build Now`. After about 5-10 minutes, you can see that the image has been built on the `Building Results` page:

> After the image is constructed, it is usually in the  <font color="orange">pending review</font> state，and the Leviathan team will complete the review <font color="green">within 1 working day</font>.
>
> The reason for this is to avoid malicious code images from entering the Leviathan ecosystem, threatening the safety of community users, so you can rest assured of the security of the Leviathan ecosystem.

Go back to the `Basic Information` page of the image, and you can get the address of the image in the `Operation Guide`:

```
docker pull talentsec/lev.whtcjdtc2008.hello_world:[image version]
```

Replace the version number with what we filled in to get the image address we need:

```
talentsec/lev.whtcjdtc2008.hello_world:v1.0
```

### 3. Local testing

Let's replace the image address inside the `Cr` function in `exp` mode with the image address we just built:

```python
def exp(...):
  ...
  return Cr(".whtcjdtc2008.hello_world:v1.0", entry=entry())
```

> After modifying the image address, it may take a while for the first local test run. This is because there is no image that has just been built locally. After the image download is complete, the tool will continue to run normally.

> Remember to comment out the pdb.set_trace() function

>The complete image address is `talentsec/lev.whtcjdtc2008.hello_world:v1.0`, but the header is not required, so the image address we fill in should be `.whtcjdtc2008.hello_world:v1.0`.

After a few minutes, you can see that the tool is still running properly after using the new image address:

### 4. Upload to Leviathan

Enter the `whtcjdtc2008.hello_world` directory, update the version number of the `pyproject.toml` configuration file, and then enter the following command to push the update to Leviathan:

```bash
pdm lev upload
```

### 5. Run on Leviathan

Open the `hello world` tool page and start running the `exp` mode with a simple configuration:

View results in less than 1 minute:

### 6. Publish to the community

We have made the image public, how can the `hello world` we created be seen by the community? Here we are going to use the publishing function of the Leviathan platform:

> Go to `Repository` - `Package Management` to find `whtcjdtc2008.hello_world` and select `Publish`

Once released, you can go to the `Market`, select the `Tool` type, and search for `hello` to see our first tool released on Leviathan!
