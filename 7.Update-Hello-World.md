## Update Hello World

### 1. Update tool information

Let's go back to the home page of the `Hello` tool and see that most of the information is blank:

In order to facilitate future maintenance and sharing with the community, you may wish to improve the page information as follows:

You can see that the completed page obviously brings life to the tool you created. ☺

### 2. Update the source code

#### 2.1 Create a new tool source code file

First, create a new file `hello.py` in the `whtcjdtc2008.hello_world/lev/whtcjdtc2008/hello_world` directory. `hello.py` will serve as the source file for the tool.

At this point, the directory structure is as follows:
```bash
./
├── __pypackages__
│   └── 3.10
│       ├── bin
│       ├── include
│       ├── lib
│       └── share
├── dist
│   ├── lev.whtcjdtc2008.hello_world-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
│   ├── lev.whtcjdtc2008.hello_world-0.1.1-py3-none-any.whl
│   └── lev.whtcjdtc2008.hello_world-0.1.2-py3-none-any.whl
├── lev
│   └── whtcjdtc2008
│       └── hello_world
│           ├── __init__.py
│           ├── __pycache__
│           └── hello.py # new file
├── main.py
└── pyproject.toml
```

#### 2.2 Improve hello.py

Migrate the tool code to `hello.py` and add some comment information. Refer to the comment block of the following code to easily understand how comments are mapped to the Tidal platform:

```python
"""
My first tool on Leviathan
Homepage: -
GitHub: -
Type: IMAGE-BASED
Version: v1.0.0
"""
from levrt import Cr, ctx, remote, annot
from levrt.annot.cats import Attck, BlackArch

@annot.meta(
    desc="Hello",
    params=[annot.Param("name", "person name")],
    cats=[Attck.Reconnaissance],
)
def hello(name: str = "world") -> Cr:
    """
    Hello World's only tool mode
    ```
    await hello("world")
    ```
    """
    @levrt.remote
    def entry():
        ctx.set(msg=f"Hello, {name}!")

    return Cr("alpine:latest", entry=entry())

__lev__ = annot.meta([hello],
                     desc = "hello world", # name of tool
                     cats = {
                        Attck: [Attck.Reconnaissance] # ATT&CK
                     })
```

At this point, the code of `_init_.py` is as follows:

```python
from levrt import annot
from . import hello

__lev__ = annot.meta([hello])
```

### 3. Update the version

There is a `pyproject.toml` file in the `whtcjdtc2008.hello_world` directory, which is used to save project-related configuration information. Here we only need to pay attention to the version number information. The overall file content is as follows:

```python
[project]
name = "lev.whtcjdtc2008.hello_world"
version = "0.1.0"
description = ""
dynamic = ["classifiers"]
requires-python = ">=3.10"
dependencies = [
    "levrt~=1.3",
]

[[project.authors]]
name = "Haotian.Wang"
email = "whtcjdtc2007@163.com"

[project.license]
text = "MIT"

[build-system]
requires = ["pdm-pep517"]
build-backend = "pdm.pep517.api"

[tool.pdm]
editable-backend = "path"
includes = ["lev"]

[[tool.pdm.source]]
name = "levhub"
url = "https://__token__:${LEVHUB_TOKEN}@pypi.lev.zone/simple/"
```

Since we updated the tool, we decided to update the version number to `0.1.1` and modify the configuration file as follows:

```python
...
version = "0.1.1"
...
```

Finally, we execute `pdm lev upload`, wait for the upload operation to complete, refresh the Leviathan tool homepage, and you can see the new tool page.
